the python file conatins web aplication built with the help streamlit. 
it contains the functionalities such as taking user inputs validating it and generating output.
it takes the company symbol(name representative) and modifies and looks up to the url at run time.
it scrapes the required data and displays on the screen.
the UI covered for this application is somewhat different but the functionalities remains the same.
though the application is unable to perform extraction (scraping) of the content from the url, 
the actual cause behind the issue is being looked after.
